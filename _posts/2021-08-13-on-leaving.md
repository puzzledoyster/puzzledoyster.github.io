excerpt: "Everyone has a story on how they'll be the ones who make it. However, as time goes on, reality filters in and (for most of us, at least), we have to confront the unpleasant and sobering possibility that ... maybe we won't be able to stay. This post consists of some musings about this issue, where I've reframed the issue as: 'Suppose if I must leave academia, what would I like to accomplish or get done so that I leave without regrets?'"

- Quote Email to Mura: 
- Self-worth
- The unknown, by its lack of dimensions, appears infinite and untransversable, and by its blackness, portentous with hidden dangers. There's an unspoken sense that there are accidents just waiting to happen: it feels like because so many things have to go right for us to make it, which only creates more opporunities for things to go wrong. Everything feels chance-y and unstable. You can't help but wonder: is there where my luck finally runs out?
- One thing at a time. 
- Birman: Do math at your own pace. One thing at a time.
- Declutter: eliminate unnecessary things.
- Gratitude for what you do have
- Resentment and bitterness doesn't do very much, other than train your focus onto things you can't control.

- Malliaris.
- Why am I here? 
- Fear is a friend, but fear is also an illusion. Allow yourself to be guided by the math, and focus on what you can control and make peace with what you can't. There are no guarantees in life anyway.
- Losing yourself by "playing the game"
- People who have made it: hard work, not talent, that matters.
