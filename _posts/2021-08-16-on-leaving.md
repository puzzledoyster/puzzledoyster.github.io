excerpt: "Everyone has a story on how they'll be the ones who make it. However, as time goes on, reality filters in. For most of us, we eventually have to confront the sobering possibility that ... maybe we won't be able to stay. This post contains some musings about this issue, inspired by a question I've posed myself: 'Suppose if I must leave academia, what would I like to accomplish so that I leave without regrets?'"

I didn't do Maths for my A-levels -- all my subjects were in the Humanities. So when I went to UChicago for my undergrad, I fully intended to be a Phil/Econ double major. Sometime during my 2nd year, the Econ major changed to a Math major instead. There were various push and pull reasons about why I chose maths and stubbornly clung onto it for this many years, but one of the main reasons was the people. I realised how much I genuinely liked and enjoyed mathematicians as people. I remember going to my first Beer Skits (invited by one of my TAs), a beloved UChicago tradition where the 2nd year math grad students put on an elaborate skit parodying all the faculty members (whilst the faculty members are in the audience!). It was ridiculous, and wonderful, and I remember thinking to myself with absolute sincerity: 'These people are really fucking cool -- I wanna be around them.' 


And of course, I grew to love Maths as well. But that goes without saying.


I've typically had a very friendly and chatty relationship with my TAs, without actually becoming close friends with them. So even after I graduated from college, I still thought about them and have wondered whatever became of them. First and obvious question: did they manage to complete their PhDs, and what did they do their theses on? I (being nosey) went onto ProQuest and looked up their names. When I found their PhD theses in the database, I got excited and could not resist having a quick peek at what they did. What did all these stress-filled and intense years of grad school cumulate into? Some theses seemed pretty decent, others seemed ... not so good. I found one was just about 30 pages long: 1/2 of it was basic exposition, and the rest was dedicated to proving what appeared to be a fairly simple theorem. Another thesis I read was less than 15 pages long, the first 10 pages were again basic exposition, with the final 4 pages contained a hurried patchwork of two propositions (which were not originally due to the author) and the final main theorem. 


My heart sank, and ached for them. I wasn't thinking of myself or prognosticating my academic fate -- I was just genuinely sad for them. I imagined their panicked sense of doom as deadlines drew steadily closer and it seemed increasingly that they had nothing to show for all their hours of hard work. I thought of overwhelming and isolating pressure they must have felt as they tried to keep going, or the simple but absolute pain of not being able to execute what they wanted to do. Their dreams were brutally crushed, and there was nothing to do about it. And so this my first brush with this unforgiving aspect of academia. My sadness carried an implicit recognition: You might really love maths, but that doesn't mean you're good enough to stay on.


In the years since, more aspects of this sobering reality have filtered through. I've been watching Mura Yakerson's recent YouTube series 'Math-Life balance' with great interest. Some of the interviews I liked and felt reassured by, others I found alienating and slightly painful to listen to. But I still got a lot of out of it. Saul Glasman, who worked in homotopy theory before eventually leaving for industry, made a remark about how academia was like a pyramid-scheme in that they're just too many grad students and not enough faculty positions for everyone: only the minority will make it to the top. This was a sentiment I've heard before, and so I wasn't caught off-guard by it. What I did find interesting was his off-hand remark that: "Everyone has a story that they tell themselves, about how they'll be the ones who make it." 

This is clearly not just true of math academia. Glausman's remark made me think of how Allison Iraheta (an American Idol contestant) claimed that she would 'set the world on fire' with her music. Or how many MMA fighters such as Conor McGregor often speak with delusions of grandeur. Or how Mima Ito (a Japanese table tennis player) repeatedly insisted that she would win the Olympic gold medal in all 3 events she was competing in, and end Chinese domination of the sport. Or how Charlotte Eades, who was diagnosed with terminal brain tumour as a teenager, insisted in her YouTube vlogs that she was going to live till she was 90.

The sobering reality reveals a different story. I don't know whatever became of Allison Iraheta but suffice to say she hasn't exactly become a household name in music. McGregor suffered devastating losses in 3 of his 4 recent fights, and has scrambled to find reasons to burnish his image as an invincible fighter. Ito did beat China once in the mixed-doubles event, but lost to China in the Women's singles and Women's Teams -- one post-match interview featured her in tears, trying to compose herself after having lost in straight 4 games to Sun Yingsha. And Charlotte Eades did not live till she was 90 - after 2.5 years of battling cancer, she died at 19, unable to speak or function properly in her final months because of how the brain tumour had spread.


The uninvested bystander is wise to the gap between hope and reality. But the question remains as to why do we even tell ourselves these stories in the first place? Why do we tell ourselves things that some small part of us knows sounds delusional?

One answer: it's because such people are naive and foolish, and have decided to ignore reality because it's too unpleasant to bear. There is certainly truth to this, but it is also glib and misleading. Cynicism in and of itself is not wisdom. Hedging your bets is only risk aversion -- it is a reaction to the unknown as opposed to the logical consequence of having correctly apprehended the relevant details of 'objective reality'. And whilst it is true that many cling to delusions because they find the stark truth too difficult to bear, it is <i>equally</i> true that it takes very little to live a life of passive mediocrity, and that many of the peanut-crunching crowd who mock those for trying to be better do so because they want to avoid the equally difficult fact they might have settled for second-best. Just ask David Goggins.

Tuning out the noise of all these defensive reactions reveals the more fundamental reason for such personal narratives: it's a way to negotiate our relationship with the unknown. The unknown, by its lack of dimensions, appears infinite and untransversable, and by its blackness, portentous with hidden dangers. There's often an unspoken sense that there are accidents just waiting to happen: it feels like because so many things have to go right for us to make it, which only creates more opporunities for things to go wrong. Everything feels chance-y and unstable. You can't help but wonder: is this where my luck finally runs out?

These stories we tell oureslves give us a reason to keep going. Yet I would emphatically deny that finding reasons to give up is the same thing as having understood reality for what it truly is. It takes fairly little talent to throw in the towel because one can always easily find reasons to give up. However, at the same time, there might actually come a point where you will have to give up a long-held dream. And there's an important distinction to appreciate here. It's one thing to have realised that you've given up a dream without meaning to -- e.g. perhaps you always meant to be a singer-songwriter, or an Olympic athlete, or work for an NGO, but you put these dreams on the backburner so you could focus on other things before suddenly realising one day that these dreams have reached their expiration date with out you realising and are now cold to the touch. It's quite another thing to give up a dream that you've been fighting to make happen. Both can be deep losses and should be mourned -- but there's a difference between losing something because you didn't try vs. losing something even when you did. The former feels inevitable (even if painful) because some part of us recognises the finiteness of our time and abilities, the latter feels more damning because we lost even when our eyes were supposed to be on the ball. 


In his interview with Mura, Glausman says that we shouldn't view ourselves as a failure even if we leave academia. I absolutely agree. If nothing else, I certainly gained a great deal from having struggled honest struggles when trying to come to grips with new maths, and I trying to push my abilities to its limits. And I also think it's worth me thinking about the prospect of potentially leaving academia, no matter how deeply I love maths, because it raises valid and urgent questions about what my priorities are. This needs careful balancing and navigation. I want to build special relationships of all kinds, and I don't want to look back embittered about how I gave up so much of my personal life for an academic career. I want to live an examined life, but it's important for me to live a full and happy life as well. At the same time, I don't want to simply throw my hands up and leave the moment things get tough -- I don't want to have to regrets about giving up too soon either. 

I want to stay. I am willing to fight to stay. But I also think, it's important to try and let go of things you cannot control (because that's a waste of energy and emotions), and focus on the things that you can control. And it's important not to lose your soul when you try to play the game just to stay in the running. 

We all have stories that we tell ourselves. This is not just the fragile flare of unreasonable hope that keeps us going in the midst of intense competition, but also encompasses other aspects of our self-image -- the personal, the moral, the political, the romantic, the sexual. I don't feel comfortable making dogmatic assertions about this right now, but provisionally: whatever the relationships are between these aspects of ourselves, it seems important to not let one aspect dominate or warp the others. It also seems to me that some stories are better than others. And right now, for me, the more useful stories are the ones that call our attention to things we can control and do right now, to aspects of ourselves that may have been quietly developing and gaining strength, to wisdom gained from experience. Stories that emphasise agency and maintain a clear-eyed perspective on what to do next as opposed to stories on why we'll be the ones to make it -- these are the stories I find helpful and empowering.   

So a thought experiment: suppose I must leave academia at some point, what would I like to accomplish before I leave? Right now, I would like to actually enjoy and cherish the rest of my PhD days esp. since I've been given the opportunity to research a topic that I chose mysel. I don't want to ever forget this or take this for granted --- even in the midst of the looming stress about the uncertain future, there is still plenty to be grateful for. And if I must leave, I would like to finish writing some papers I've always meant to write, because I think these ideas will be helpful in moving the conversation forward in interesting ways. And personally, I would like to grow as much as I can during this time, because this is the one time where the cultivation of one's mind and abilities is an end of itself as opposed to a means -- another privilege. 


This is the story I'm telling myself right now. I don't want to leave. But if I do, then I'm going to do so without regrets or feeling like I've left certain things unfinished. I will have done absolutely everything that I could reasonably expect myself to do, and then some. And I don't want to have wasted time over pointless emotional handwringing. Ultimately, no matter what happens in the end, I want to live a full life with no regrets, and I want to know how to make the next step forward. And this story gives me a clearer sense of how to do just that. To be continued.
