- Quote Email to Mura: 
- Self-worth
- The unknown, by its lack of dimensions, appears infinite and untransversable, and by its blackness, portentous with hidden dangers. There's an unspoken sense that there are accidents just waiting to happen, because so many things have to go right which creates more opporunities for things to go wrong. Everything feels chance-y and unstable.
- One thing at a time. 
- Birman: Do math at your own pace. One thing at a time.
- Declutter: eliminate unnecessary things.
- Gratitude for what you do have, 

- Malliaris.
- Why am I here? 
- Fear is a friend, but fear is also an illusion. Allow yourself to be guided by the math, and focus on what you can control and make peace with what you can't. There are no guarantees in life anyway.
- Losing yourself by "playing the game"
- People who have made it: hard work, not talent, that matters.
