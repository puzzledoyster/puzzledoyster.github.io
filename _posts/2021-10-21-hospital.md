excerpt: "Everyone has a story on how they'll be the ones who make it. However, most of us will eventually have to confront the sobering possibility that ... maybe it's time to give up certain long-held dreams. This post contains some musings about this issue, framed by the following question: 'Suppose if I must leave academia, what would I like to accomplish so that I leave without regrets?'"

I didn't do Maths for my A-levels -- all my subjects were in the Humanities. So when I went to UChicago for my undergrad, I fully intended to be a Phil/Econ double major. Sometime during my 2nd year, the Econ major changed to a Math major instead. There were various push and pull reasons about why I chose maths and stubbornly clung onto it for this many years, but one of the main reasons was the people. I realised how much I genuinely liked and enjoyed mathematicians as people. I remember going to my first Beer Skits (invited by one of my TAs), a beloved UChicago tradition where the 2nd year math grad students put on an elaborate skit parodying all the faculty members (whilst said faculty members are in the audience!). It was ridiculous, and wonderful, and I remember thinking to myself with absolute sincerity: 'These people are really fucking cool -- I wanna be around them.' 


And of course, I grew to love Maths as well. But that goes without saying.
