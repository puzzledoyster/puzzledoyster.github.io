<b>What I'm doing now:</b> I am currently a JSPS PostDoc Fellow at Nagoya University, hosted by Takayuki Kihara. 

<b>What I'm thinking about:</b> My research lies in **Topology** and **Logic**, spanning both fields independently as well as their rich interface. A key idea underscoring my research is the question: "What is a space?" When abstracted in the right way and placed in the right contexts, this question can be both subtle and surprisingly powerful.

My PhD work investigated various interactions between arithmetic geometry and logic, guided by the unique lens of topos theory. 

<ul><li> Thesis : Adelic Geometry via Topos Theory <a href="/publications/FINALSUBMISSION.pdf">PDF</a>. Here's a brief <a href="/publications/ThesisWork.pdf"> overview</a>. </li></ul>
 
In addition, I also like to think about:

<ul><li> K-theory of Varieties, G-Manifolds, Matroids etc. 
  </li></ul>
<ul><li> <i>Interfaces with Logic.</i> Keisler's Order, Computability Theory, Hrushovski-Loeser Theory, Learning Theory etc.
  </li></ul>
  <ul><li> <i>Distribution of Rational Points.</i> In Spring 2023, I co-organised the <a href="https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/rosa.winter/StudyGroupManinSzemeredi.html"> London Algebraic NT study group on Manin's Conjecture & Szemeredi Regularity</a> with Rosa Winter. Here is the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/tsvffxxjhzyz"> syllabus</a>.
  </li></ul>


<b>Academic Background:</b> I was previously a PostDoc at Queen Mary University of London, under the supervision of Ivan Tomasic and Behrang Noohi. I did my PhD at the University of Birmingham, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~sjv/" target ="_blank"> Steve Vickers</a>.
