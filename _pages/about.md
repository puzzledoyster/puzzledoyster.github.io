I am currently a PhD student at the University of Birmingham, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~sjv/" target ="_blank"> Steve Vickers</a>. Although my research interests lie firmly in the area of pure mathematics, I am a member of the Theoretical Computer Science group since this is the official habitat allotted to the category theorists by the university. 

My research area is in Applications of Topos Theory to Number Theory (esp. Diophantine Geometry) and Homotopy Theory. The main focus of my PhD research involves developing a version of adelic geometry via topos theory, but I've also recently become more seriously interested in K-theory, chromatic homotopy theory as well as local-global problems in arithmetic geometry. 


Prior to my time at Birmingham, I did my Masters at Durham University and I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago. My MSc thesis was on Birman-Williams' work on Lorentz knots, and my BA thesis was on Aquinas' Third Way.
