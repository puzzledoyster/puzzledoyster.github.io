<b>What I'm doing now:</b> I am currently a PostDoc at Queen Mary University of London, under the supervision of Ivan Tomasic.

<b>What I'm thinking about:</b> Topos theory, at its core, is motivated by recognising topological ideas in settings which are not obviously topological -- e.g. in algebraic geometry (etale cohomology), or in logic (the classifying topos of geometric theories). My PhD work involved investigating various interactions between the number theory & the logic, guided through the lens of topology. 

<ul><li> Thesis : Adelic Geometry via Topos Theory <a href="/publications/FINALSUBMISSION.pdf">PDF</a>. Here's a brief <a href="/publications/Introduction.pdf"> overview</a>. </li></ul>
 
Aside from developing the various ideas explored in my thesis, I'm also thinking about:

<ul><li> Interactions between model theory & topos theory: AECs, Hrushovski-Loeser types, characterising saturated models etc.
  </li></ul>
  <ul><li> Distribution of Rational Points: In Spring 2023, I co-organised the <a href="https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/rosa.winter/StudyGroupManinSzemeredi.html"> London Algebraic NT study group on Manin's Conjecture & Szemeredi Regularity</a> with Rosa Winter. Here is the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/tsvffxxjhzyz"> syllabus</a>.

<b>Academic Background:</b> I did my PhD at the University of Birmingham, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~sjv/" target ="_blank"> Steve Vickers</a>. Prior to my time at Birmingham, I did my Masters at Durham University and my undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago. My MSc thesis was on Birman-Williams' work on Lorenz knots. My BA thesis was on Aquinas' 3rd Way.
