<b>What I'm doing now:</b> I am currently a PostDoc at Queen Mary University of London, under the supervision of Ivan Tomasic and Behrang Noohi. Starting December 2024, I will be a JSPS PostDoc Fellow at Nagoya University, hosted by Takayuki Kihara.


<b>What I'm thinking about:</b> My research lies in **Topology** and **Logic**, spanning both fields independently as well as their rich interface. A key idea underscoring my research is the question: "What is a space?" When abstracted in the right way and placed in the right contexts, this question can be both subtle and surprisingly powerful.

My PhD work investigated various interactions between arithmetic geometry and logic, guided by the unique lens of topos theory. 

<ul><li> Thesis : Adelic Geometry via Topos Theory <a href="/publications/FINALSUBMISSION.pdf">PDF</a>. Here's a brief <a href="/publications/ThesisWork.pdf"> overview</a>. </li></ul>
 
In addition, I also like to think about:

<ul><li> K-theory of Varieties, G-Manifolds, Matroids etc. 
  </li></ul>
<ul><li> <i>Interactions between Model Theory & Topos Theory</i>. Perspectives on Keisler's Order, Hrushovski-Loeser Theory, AECs, etc.
  </li></ul>
  <ul><li> <i>Distribution of Rational Points.</i> In Spring 2023, I co-organised the <a href="https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/rosa.winter/StudyGroupManinSzemeredi.html"> London Algebraic NT study group on Manin's Conjecture & Szemeredi Regularity</a> with Rosa Winter. Here is the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/tsvffxxjhzyz"> syllabus</a>.
  </li></ul>


<b>Academic Background:</b> I did my PhD at the University of Birmingham, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~sjv/" target ="_blank"> Steve Vickers</a>. Prior to my time at Birmingham, I did my Masters at Durham University and my undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago. My MSc thesis was on Birman-Williams' work on Lorenz knots. My BA thesis was on Aquinas' 3rd Way.
