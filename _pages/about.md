I am currently a PhD student at the University of Birmingham, under the supervision of Steven Vickers. Although my research interests lie very firmly in the area of pure mathematics, I am a member of the Theoretical Computer Science group since this is the natural habitat allotted to category theorists at UoB.

My research area is in Applications of Topos Theory to Number Theory (esp. Diophantine Geometry) and Homotopy Theory. The main focus of my PhD research involves developing a version of adelic geometry via topos theory, but recently I have also become more seriously interested in K-theory and chromatic homotopy theory.
