<b>What I'm doing now:</b> I am currently a PhD student at the University of Birmingham, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~sjv/" target ="_blank"> Steve Vickers</a>. Although my research interests primarily lie in the area of pure mathematics, I am a member of the Theoretical Computer Science group since this is the official habitat of the category theorists at my university. 

<b>Research Area:</b> The main focus of my research involves developing a version of adelic geometry via topos theory, as well as exploring its interactions with Local-Global problems (both in number theory and homotopy theory). However, I also have side-projects relating to K-theory (particularly in relation to scissors congruence), tensor-triangulated categories, Manin's Conjecture, and Abstract Elementary Classes.


<b>Academic Background:</b> Prior to my time at Birmingham, I did my Masters at Durham University and I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago. My MSc thesis was on Birman-Williams' work on Lorenz knots. My BA thesis was on Aquinas' 3rd Way.
